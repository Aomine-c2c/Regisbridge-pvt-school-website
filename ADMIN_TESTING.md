# Admin Interface Testing Guide

## Overview
Complete admin interface has been implemented with user management, analytics dashboard, and stub components for future features.

## Test Admin User Credentials
```
Email: admin@regisbridge.edu
Password: Admin123!
```

**Note:** This admin user is automatically seeded when the server starts. Check server console for confirmation.

## Quick Start

### 1. Verify Servers Are Running
- **Backend:** http://localhost:3002 (should show API info)
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:8080 (main application)

### 2. Login as Admin
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/login
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `admin@regisbridge.edu`
   - Password: `Admin123!`
3. Click "Sign In"

### 3. Access Admin Dashboard
1. After login, navigate to http://localhost:8080/admin
2. Should see admin dashboard with 8 tabs

### ✅ Backend API Testing

#### Analytics Endpoints (Mock Data)
```bash
# Get dashboard stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/analytics/overview

# Get enrollment data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/analytics/enrollment?year=2025

# Get revenue data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/analytics/revenue?year=2025

# Get activity logs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/activity-logs?limit=10
```

#### User Management Endpoints
```bash
# List all users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/users

# List with filters
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" "http://localhost:3002/api/admin/users?role=student&status=active&page=1&limit=10"

# Get single user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/users/USER_ID

# Create user
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","role":"student","password":"Test123"}' \
  http://localhost:3002/api/admin/users

# Update user
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Updated"}' \
  http://localhost:3002/api/admin/users/USER_ID

# Delete user
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/users/USER_ID

# Export to CSV
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/api/admin/export/users
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with actual JWT token from login, and `USER_ID` with actual user ID.

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ User Management: **Fully functional** with CRUD operations
- ✅ Overview Dashboard: **Functional** with mock analytics data
- ⏳ Student Management: **Stub only** (ready for implementation)
- ⏳ Content Management: **Stub only** (ready for implementation)
- ⏳ Academic Management: **Stub only** (ready for implementation)
- ⏳ Finance Management: **Stub only** (ready for implementation)
- ⏳ Reports & Analytics: **Stub only** (ready for implementation)
- ⏳ Settings: **Stub only** (ready for implementation)

### Data Storage
- **In-memory storage:** All data stored in Map() (lost on server restart)
- **Production:** Requires database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

### Mock Data
- **Analytics:** Enrollment and revenue charts show mock data
- **Activity logs:** Sample entries only
- **Production:** Replace with real database queries

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot access /admin
**Symptom:** Redirects to homepage
**Solution:** Verify you're logged in as admin role

### Server not responding
**Symptom:** API calls fail
**Solution:** Check server is running on port 3002

### Frontend not loading
**Symptom:** White screen or errors
**Solution:** Check frontend server is running on port 8080

### Admin user not created
**Symptom:** Cannot login with admin credentials
**Solution:** Check server console for "Admin user seeded" message

### Token expired
**Symptom:** 401 errors on API calls
**Solution:** Logout and login again to get fresh token

## Next Steps

### Phase 10: Documentation
- [x] Admin testing guide (this file)
- [ ] Admin API documentation
- [ ] Developer guide for extending admin
- [ ] Update main README with admin features

### Future Enhancements
1. **Student Management:** Full enrollment form, grades, attendance
2. **Content Management:** Rich text editor, news CRUD, events
3. **Academic Management:** Class schedules, teacher assignments
4. **Finance Management:** Payment tracking, invoices, fee structures
5. **Reports:** Custom report builder, advanced analytics
6. **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration
7. **File Uploads:** Profile photos, documents
8. **Email Notifications:** Admin action triggers
9. **Activity Logging:** Complete audit trail to database
10. **Production Deployment:** Environment variables, security hardening
