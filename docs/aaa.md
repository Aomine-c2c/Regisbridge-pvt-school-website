MONTHLY REPORT
PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT 15/03/21 TO 21/04/21
REPORT COMPILED BY: HEAD:  T. MUTAMBASERE
Preamble: 
The period covered by this report comes in a unique period of the year where schools which normally open in January had to open in March due to the global pandemic disease called Covid 19. This outbreak caused schools to close and after that we had many on and offs due to lockdowns and curfews.
Introduction: 
The report is expected to cover areas like enrolment figures, at the beginning of the term and current, staffing, academic work, professional work, physical development, meetings, problems and solutions, learners welfare, fees, boarding etc. It is hoped that at the end of this report a clear picture of the situation at school will have been put into proper perspective.
Enrolment: 
When schools opened on March 15 the school enrolment figures were as follows
Class	As at opening	current
	male	Female	total	Male	female	total
ECD A	10	14	24	5	11	16
ECD B1	11	16	27	22	24	46
ECD B2	13	16	29	14	16	30
GRADE 1A	10	10	20	10	10	20
Grade 1b	10	8	18	11	9	20
Grade 2a	10	7	17	11	8	19
Grader 2b	9	7	16	10	7	17
Grade 3	17	14	31	19	14	33
Grade 4	14	15	29	10	9	19
Grade 5	10	8	18	8	8	16
Grade 6	10	8	18	11	10	21
Grade 7	6	4	10	6	4	10
						
Total	130	128	258	127	149	286
From the beginning the indications were that ECDs, grade 1, 2 and 3 were going to grow since on daily basis the school was enrolling more and more learners. Anticipation for new teachers was therefore something the school was looking forward to.
Staffing:  
At opening schools, the staff compliment was 13 excluding the French teacher who is under the school project. To date the teachers and their qualifications are as follows.

Of the 15 teachers at present 3 have degrees in Education and 6 have Diplomas in Education General while the rest of them have Diplomas in ECD. The staff therefore is highly qualified. As for experience only two with general diplomas have very little experience, the rest range from 2 to 10 years. The head has more than 20 years of experience as a teacher and head.
Academic work and professional work
During the month of March, some textbooks and stationery were bought. Although text books were few, it helped to augment what already existed. It is hoped that more will be bought. Grade 3 and 4 started with two teachers only. As numbers had grown, it became necessary to recruit more teachers. Ms Nhende and Ms Nyamaropa R were recruited. The burden was however not alleviated. Mr Mutsvanemoto for grade 3 and Ms Nyadenga G for ECD reported for duty well into the month. Their reasons for being absent were acceptable. However, immediately Mr Mutsvanemoto resigned citing wife’s poor health. Up to now he has not been replaced. Ms Nyamaropa is taking a class of 33 learners. The staff has a total number of 6 managers that is Mr Mutambasere, new and joined the school on 15 March, Mr Mhlanga the deputy head, Ms Munyani the TIC, Mr Mafunga for ICT, Mr Nyadenga S.

Physical Development
One by three rooms classroom block and one staff house continue to be under construction since opening. To date they are both at roofing stage. School grounds are looking satisfactorily. A lot of grass has been cut short. Bushes around the school perimeter have been cleared. The grass around the basketball court has however still have to be cut further short. Shrubs have been neatly shaped and they are looking so good. However there is still need to repair the two main gates so that domestic animals do not enter the school premises.
Meetings
A number of meetings have been held at the school. The first was a meeting with the parents with learners who reside at boarding. This was held on 21/03/21. A financial report was presented. The new head was introduced to parents. The parents were made to understand that the amount of $150 per term they were paying was not sufficient. They agreed to increase it by $60 to $210USD payable by end of April. The deputy head and teachers met and paved way for teachers to start their work in earnest schemes of work were to be submitted after a week
The head and the directors held a number of meetings. Topics discussed included the boarding, school culture, the uniforms, recruitment of teachers, absenteeism, physical developments, head’s reports, salaries etc. The head had some meetings with the staff and briefings on a number of occasions. Topics discussed included report backs on meetings attended by the head, expectations, class displays, starting and knocking off times etc. Besides meeting the school staff members, the head also met the school prefects. Together, they discussed the role of prefects, behaviours and duties to be done by the prefects. The head also had a meeting with the staff members who look after kids at the boarding. Such topics as caring, holidays, food etc were discussed.
The Annual General Meeting
The School Annual General meeting was held on 17 March 2021. The meeting went on well. The deputy introduced the members of staff and the new head to the parents. Parents adopted both the 2020 financial report and the 2021 proposed budget. The budget came out with a school fees structure of $180usd for ECD and $225usd for grade 1to7
The head, SDC chair and the Grade 7 teacher attended the DSI meeting in Kadoma on 21/04/21. The heads had a separate meeting where issues like the need to pay B.S.P.Z were discussed. The DSI encouraged schools to hold AGMs at their schools. He pointed out the need to have an approval letter from the Ministry before collecting fees. Some of the issues included the covid 19, catch up strategies, discipline in schools, registration of Private Schools and many more.
School fees
Since the lockdown our learners did not come to school. Arrangement of online lessons was arranged. As a result, to date monies to be paid since January are:
Grade 1 to 7
Description	Amount per learner per term
Online lessons	$ 36
Covid 19 levies	$ 25
School fees	$ 150
School fees	$ 75
Total	$ 286

ECD
Description	Amount per learner per term
Online lessons	$ 36
Covid 19 levies	$ 25
School fees	$ 120
School fees	$ 60
Total	$ 241

Boarding fees per learner per term
   $ 150 usd	old fee	s										+ $   60 usd	top up												   $ 210 usd –  to date
This was with effect from 17 April 2021. Although quite a substantial number of learners have paid their school fees, we still have a good number who have not yet completely paid up the 2021 term 1 school fees. The collection of fees has a challenge, since parents have to buy winter uniforms at the same time. This is a unique term because of the Covid 19 pandemic. Parents are therefore struggling to make ends meet. However some parents are just reluctant because they suspect schools to close again because of the so called 3rd wave. As for next term online fees and Covid 19 levies will fall off learning $225USD for Grade 1-7 and $180USD for ECD
Calendar of events
During this period, a calendar of events was set up for the term as follows.
Civvies		12 May 2021
Termly tests		17-29 May 2021
Consultation		31 May – 3 June 2021
Closing date		4 June 2021

Besides this calendar of events, the school received the school calendar for 2021. The calendar is as follows:
TERM 	OPEN	CLOSE
1	22/03/2021	04/06/2021
2	28/06/2021	10/09/2021
3	04/10/2021	17/12/2021

Learners’ welfare
During this Covid 19 era the kids have at least 5 masks each. The social distancing is not more than 20 kids per class.at the gate as kids enter, they wash their hands, get sanitized and also temperature checked. Classrooms are often fumigated.
Boarding learners’ welfare
Those residing at school get clean food with a specified time table and diet. Their rooms and toilets are cleaned daily. We have both assigned members of staff four of them and 2 kitchen staff. They have a Television set to entertain them as well as a telephone facility in case their parents want to speak to them. Some parents have not yet updated the payment of boarding and school fees.
Teachers’ welfare
Teachers receive tea at ten o’clock with bread and lunch at one o’clock. During this month their salaried were increased with percentages ranging from 30 to 40%. However the effective date will be the month of May.
Flow of finances 
During this month, the school generated its funds mainly from the collection of school fees. However the flow has not been so good. Many parents have paid for their kids save for the $75usd top up which they seem to be struggling to pay. Just a few had been allowed to enter onto a payment plan. It is hoped that by the end of the term very few of the learners will be owing the school. To ease the finance challenge the school intends to embark on income generating projects. So far Bee keeping and chicken rearing have been identified.
Sports 
The school had started practicing in athletics. Learners were divided into houses. However due to Covid 19, the whole idea was abandoned. It is prudent that the school looks for avenues to do certain activities that conform to the Covid 19 protocols. The sports master will soon come up with safe sporting activities.

Conclusion
Despite many obstacles caused by Covid 19 pandemic that caused the mixing of the normal summer and winter terms as well as limited flow of funds the school is struggling to keep up with delivering quality education to the learners. As to alleviate some of the problems especially on the supply of funds, plans are underway to embark on income generating projects
Way forward
Should funds permit, the following need to be attended to
The purchase of more textbooks from ECD to Grade 7
The provision of more toys in ECD department
The provision of more TV and laps in the ECD department and repainting of the play centre
The provision of more garden tools for the grounds men as well as work suits
Acquisition of extra equipment for Covid 19 e.g. another thermometer and extra suits etc
The provision of more writing boards in classrooms
Repair of all broken furniture and purchase of new chairs for infant classes
Repair of the toilet and shower systems in the boarding house
The repainting of the entire school building 
Completion of the staff house and the classroom block

Consequences of non-compliance
Discipline is intended to promote the learning of self control and to change the inappropriate behaviour .Expected behaviour must be taught both at home and at school. The strategies that are used to develop understanding and respect for the code may vary from student to student. When there is non- compliance with the behavioural expectations of the code, despite application of these strategies appropriate consequences should be initiated. The following principles must be applied:

Consequences will be appropriate for the student’s stage of development and in consideration of the student’s special needs
Consequences will reflect the severity of misbehavior and take into account the frequency and duration of  the misbehavior.
Consequences will be chosen primarily for their educational value
Consequences will make sense to the student as much as possible
Consequences will timed appropriately 

Please note that
Inappropriate behaviour should never be ignored
Appropriate action should always be taken
Immediate action should be taken to stop behaviour
Additional action in the form of intervention should be designed in order to produce constructive change

Corporal punishment.
Use of collective responsibility (group punishment) in disciplinary procedures.

use of  evaluation  procedures  as  a disciplinary procedure ; i.e.. arbitrarily  assigning  a  test  to  an  individual  or  class
 immobilisation,  isolation or any other humiliating or frightening techniques





 Effective Guidance
The goal of effective guidance is to assist children in becoming confident, fully functioning individuals who can make decisions and direct themselves appropriately. Young children are enormously influenced by their social environment, giving those who interact with children a responsibility to create an appropriate atmosphere using sensitive and effective guidance skills.

Regisbridge believes that there are many steps involved in guiding children’s behaviour.

Prevention
 This involves assessing the child's level of development, looking at what is happening in the environment and planning accordingly. It is important to be positive and consistent. Clear realistic limits should be set for activities and behaviour, and there should be effective communication with children and other staff. Children should be aware of the consequences of behaviour both positive and negative.
Encouraging 
Children should be given constant encouragement when they are displaying appropriate behaviour. Staff should avoid giving lots of attention for negative behaviour and just accepting positive behaviour. Staff needs to acknowledge and encourage positive behaviour.
Recording
 Adequate records should be kept on the children. In the case of children who consistently display challenging behaviours, it is important to observe situations in order to learn more about the behaviour.
 Effective limit need to be developed with the children in mind and not for the connivance of the caregivers. Clear verbal and physical direction of what is acceptable rather than what is not. Limits need to be developmentally appropriate to children and take into account children’s age and stage.
Redirection
Redirection of unacceptable behaviour is an effective method of positive guidance. It means attempting to turn the child’s attention away from unacceptable behaviour towards an experience or behaviour that is acceptable. This alternative experience should be as interesting to the child, thus allows an outlet for their feelings.
Distraction
 Distraction is a good guidance tool for younger children. It involves changing the focus of the child’s attention.
 Ignoring
 Once a particular behaviour has been judged consistent and problematic, ignoring will be used as a technique to reduce the inappropriate behaviour. Points to consider when ignoring the behaviour 
do not ignore harmful behaviour, 
the effects of ignoring are not usually immediate,
 behaviour may get worse before it gets better, 
ignoring needs to be verbal and nonverbal, any re-emergence of behaviour must be ignored, behaviour needs to be ignored by everyone,
Natural Consequences occur as a result of the child’s behaviour without intervention. For example a child who refuses to eat, doesn’t get to eat till the next meal and is therefore hungry. Natural consequences are not to be used in dangerous situations.

Consequences of non-compliance
Discipline is intended to promote the learning of self control and to change the inappropriate behaviour .Expected behaviour must be taught both at home and at school. The strategies that are used to develop understanding and respect for the code may vary from student to student. When there is non- compliance with the behavioural expectations of the code, despite application of these strategies appropriate consequences should be initiated. The following principles must be applied:

Consequences will be appropriate for the student’s stage of development and in consideration of the student’s special needs
Consequences will reflect the severity of misbehavior and take into account the frequency and duration of  the misbehavior.
Consequences will be chosen primarily for their educational value
Consequences will make sense to the student as much as possible
Consequences will timed appropriately 

Please note that
Inappropriate behaviour should never be ignored
Appropriate action should always be taken
Immediate action should be taken to stop behaviour
Additional action in the form of intervention should be designed in order to produce constructive change

Consequences Specifically Forbidden
The following consequences  are  not  appropriate   responses  to  any  type  of  misconduct:
Corporal punishment.
Use of collective responsibility (group punishment) in disciplinary procedures.
use of  academic  work  as a  disciplinary  procedure; i.e, assigning    extra  academic   work  to   punish  misbehaviour .
use of  evaluation  procedures  as  a disciplinary procedure ; i.e.. arbitrarily  assigning  a  test  to  an  individual  or  class
 immobilisation,  isolation or any other humiliating or frightening techniques





 Effective Guidance
The goal of effective guidance is to assist children in becoming confident, fully functioning individuals who can make decisions and direct themselves appropriately. Young children are enormously influenced by their social environment, giving those who interact with children a responsibility to create an appropriate atmosphere using sensitive and effective guidance skills.

Regisbridge believes that there are many steps involved in guiding children’s behaviour.

Prevention
 This involves assessing the child's level of development, looking at what is happening in the environment and planning accordingly. It is important to be positive and consistent. Clear realistic limits should be set for activities and behaviour, and there should be effective communication with children and other staff. Children should be aware of the consequences of behaviour both positive and negative.
Encouraging 
Children should be given constant encouragement when they are displaying appropriate behaviour. Staff should avoid giving lots of attention for negative behaviour and just accepting positive behaviour. Staff needs to acknowledge and encourage positive behaviour.
Recording
 Adequate records should be kept on the children. In the case of children who consistently display challenging behaviours, it is important to observe situations in order to learn more about the behaviour.
 Effective limit need to be developed with the children in mind and not for the connivance of the caregivers. Clear verbal and physical direction of what is acceptable rather than what is not. Limits need to be developmentally appropriate to children and take into account children’s age and stage.
Redirection
Redirection of unacceptable behaviour is an effective method of positive guidance. It means attempting to turn the child’s attention away from unacceptable behaviour towards an experience or behaviour that is acceptable. This alternative experience should be as interesting to the child, thus allows an outlet for their feelings.
Distraction
 Distraction is a good guidance tool for younger children. It involves changing the focus of the child’s attention.
 Ignoring
 Once a particular behaviour has been judged consistent and problematic, ignoring will be used as a technique to reduce the inappropriate behaviour. Points to consider when ignoring the behaviour 
do not ignore harmful behaviour, 
the effects of ignoring are not usually immediate,
 behaviour may get worse before it gets better, 
ignoring needs to be verbal and nonverbal, any re-emergence of behaviour must be ignored, behaviour needs to be ignored by everyone,
Natural Consequences occur as a result of the child’s behaviour without intervention. For example a child who refuses to eat, doesn’t get to eat till the next meal and is therefore hungry. Natural consequences are not to be used in dangerous situations.
Logical consequences requires the intervention of the caregiver and acknowledges mutual rights, mutual respect and responsibility,. To be effective children must see them as logical. For example if you throw something – you need to go and pick it up.
Please Note: All guidance strategies need to be done in a positive manner, which avoids power struggles. Staff shall seek support and assistance from the Head when needed.
Some guidelines that can be used by staff:
Establishing trust and respect for each child.
Ensure that all children are treated equally.
Plan a variety of quiet and active activities to prevent over excitement
Give sufficient notice that a change of activity or routine is about to occur
Avoid using don’t and no.
All behaviour management techniques need to be discussed and developed in conjunction with parents. If the behaviour continues to be unacceptable this should be discussed with the Head and parents with a view to seeking additional help and support from specialist services.

Consequences of non-compliance
Discipline is intended to promote the learning of self control and to change the inappropriate behaviour .Expected behaviour must be taught both at home and at school. The strategies that are used to develop understanding and respect for the code may vary from student to student. When there is non- compliance with the behavioural expectations of the code, despite application of these strategies appropriate consequences should be initiated. The following principles must be applied:

Consequences will be appropriate for the student’s stage of development and in consideration of the student’s special needs
Consequences will reflect the severity of misbehavior and take into account the frequency and duration of  the misbehavior.
Consequences will be chosen primarily for their educational value
Consequences will make sense to the student as much as possible

Please note that
Inappropriate behaviour should never be ignored
Appropriate action should always be taken
Immediate action should be taken to stop behaviour

Use of  academic  work  as a  disciplinary  procedure; i.e, assigning    extra  academic   work  to   punish  misbehaviour .
Use of  evaluation  procedures  as  a disciplinary procedure ; i.e.. arbitrarily  assigning  a  test  to  an  individual  or  class
 Immobilisation,  isolation or any other humiliating or frightening techniques






 Effective Guidance
The goal of effective guidance is to assist children in becoming confident, fully functioning individuals who can make decisions and direct themselves appropriately. Young children are enormously influenced by their social environment, giving those who interact with children a responsibility to create an appropriate atmosphere using sensitive and effective guidance skills.

Regisbridge believes that there are many steps involved in guiding children’s behaviour.

Prevention
 This involves assessing the child's level of development, looking at what is happening in the environment and planning accordingly. It is important to be positive and consistent. Clear realistic limits should be set for activities and behaviour, and there should be effective communication with children and other staff. Children should be aware of the consequences of behaviour both positive and negative.
Encouraging 
Children should be given constant encouragement when they are displaying appropriate behaviour. Staff should avoid giving lots of attention for negative behaviour and just accepting positive behaviour. Staff needs to acknowledge and encourage positive behaviour.
Recording
 Adequate records should be kept on the children. In the case of children who consistently display challenging behaviours, it is important to observe situations in order to learn more about the behaviour.
 Effective limit need to be developed with the children in mind and not for the connivance of the caregivers. Clear verbal and physical direction of what is acceptable rather than what is not. Limits need to be developmentally appropriate to children and take into account children’s age and stage.
Redirection
Redirection of unacceptable behaviour is an effective method of positive guidance. It means attempting to turn the child’s attention away from unacceptable behaviour towards an experience or behaviour that is acceptable. This alternative experience should be as interesting to the child, thus allows an outlet for their feelings.
Distraction
 Distraction is a good guidance tool for younger children. It involves changing the focus of the child’s attention.
 Ignoring
 Once a particular behaviour has been judged consistent and problematic, ignoring will be used as a technique to reduce the inappropriate behaviour. Points to consider when ignoring the behaviour 
do not ignore harmful behaviour, 
the effects of ignoring are not usually immediate,
 behaviour may get worse before it gets better, 
ignoring needs to be verbal and nonverbal, any re-emergence of behaviour must be ignored, behaviour needs to be ignored by everyone,
Natural Consequences occur as a result of the child’s behaviour without intervention. For example a child who refuses to eat, doesn’t get to eat till the next meal and is therefore hungry. Natural consequences are not to be used in dangerous situations.
Logical consequences requires the intervention of the caregiver and acknowledges mutual rights, mutual respect and responsibility,. To be effective children must see them as logical. For example if you throw something – you need to go and pick it up.
Please Note: All guidance strategies need to be done in a positive manner, which avoids power struggles. Staff shall seek support and assistance from the Head when needed.
Some guidelines that can be used by staff:
Establishing trust and respect for each child.
Ensure that all children are treated equally.
Plan a variety of quiet and active activities to prevent over excitement
Give sufficient notice that a change of activity or routine is about to occur
Avoid using don’t and no.
All behaviour management techniques need to be discussed and developed in conjunction with parents. If the behaviour continues to be unacceptable this should be discussed with the Head and parents with a view to seeking additional help and support from specialist services.

TERM 1 2021 NEWSLETTER FOR REGISBRIDGE PRIVATE PRIMARY  SCHOOL
Compliments of the new season. Regisbridge Private Primary School is pleased to welcome you all parents. This Newsletter comes to you in the background of a new Head taking over from Mr Musodza who resigned in February 2021. 
We really compliment him for the good work he did.. The 2020 academic year was full of unanticipated developments due to the covid 19 pandemic which has forced us to get into a new nomal.
What started overseas soon became a reality in our schools. This necessitated the closing of schools in March, six days before the ending of the school term. The Covid 19 is a viral disease that is yet to have a cure, its so pandemic that it kills many people in a short space of time and can spread so fast.
As a result many countries in Africa and abroad Zimbabwe included were forced to have Lockdowns and curfews in a bid to fight the fast spread of this disease. This happened to our school which remained closed until October 2020 when Grade 7s were allowed to come and write their examininations. The traditional activities like Graduation were so difficult to organise, it was however finally successfully held on 19 December 2020.
2021 As Regisbridge school we strongly believe that we should endeavour to excel in whatever activity we carry out at school be it academic,sports or otherwise. Our learners and parents are going to get satisfaction in whatever we will do as a team with their support. 
Academics 
The Grade 7 class for 2020 had 12 learners. The analysis show that the pass percentage in three subjects of the five was 100% This was in English, Shona and General Paper. The other two had percentages above 75%. This was so good.However we continue to endovour to do more than this in 2021. 
Below is a summary of results for our Grade 7 learners in 2021.
Subject	Units	No of learners	Candidates
English	1	3	12
Maths	1	4	12
Shona	1	1	12
Genaral Paper	1	4	12
Agriculture	1	4	12
 
Only two learners failed to pass with 6 or better in all the 5 subjects, giving us a percentage pass rate of 83.5 % Mathemetics gave our candidates difficulties with a pass rate of 75%. In order to improve our 2021 grade 7 results we are going to increase studying time to include morning work and week-end studies. More and more past examination paper are going to be made use of, teachers will be encouraged to give more home work. We will try and source for resource persons as much as possible especially in subjects like Maths and Agriculture.
In addition learners will be encouraged to visit villages or go to their rural areas during holidays so as to learn more about Shona artifacts like duri, mutswi, rusero etc. Learners will be asked to display some of the articles they will have brought from home. The use of videos, CDS and the TV will make learning exciting especially in subjects like Science and Agriculture. The support of parents in this regard will be highly appreciated. Most learners were enrolled at Secondary schools of their choices, it gave the school much pleasure and pride.
Time- Tables
The school master time table has been re-visited and some adjustments made for both academics and sporting activities for balancing purposes. Our winter  time table starts at exactly 0815am for primary and 0845am for ECDs. Tuesdays and Thursday are our Sports Days. Thefore we expect learners to come in their Sports Attires.
Mondays and Wednesdays are reserved for Assembly hence learners should puts on their purple blazers and purple sun  hats.  In winter they should put on long sleeved jerseys and tracksuits
Grade 7 New Syllabus Examination 
As from this year. Grade 7 are going to be examined in the following subjects for  the first time:
1.Mathematics
2.English Language
3.Indigenous Language- Shona
4.Agriculture, Science and Technololgy
5.Social Sciences
6.Phsical Education and Arts
Parents are therefore urged to buy the necessary books for their kids homework. Although the school can buy some of the Text books, it does not have the capacity to buy all the books required. As we depart from the old syllabus system  total support from parents is expected.
Staffing and Recruitment
The school has a staff compliment of 15 teachers. Of these 6 are male and 9 female. Among the female teachers one of them is teaching French a development which even parents should make use of,in order to learn French. As for qualifications, all our teachers are qualified rangingfrom Diploma in Education to Bachelor of Eduation degrees. Our children are therefore in good hands.
In the ECD department all the teachers specialised in Infant teaching for their Diplomas. This department has a total of 91 learners ranging from ECD A less than 4 years and ECD B more than four years. Thank you parents for entrusting us with your kids. English is our medium of instruction. This is used from ECD up to grade 7. Our learners are enjoying conversing in this language.
Mr Musodza resigned as Head. His place was taken by a new man Mr Mutambasere as from 15 March 2021. Two new teachers  also joined up on  29 March 2021. Our term due to covid will run from 15 March to 4 June 2021.
Infrastructural Development
In 2019 a gaiant step was taken despite economic challenges which we are facing, to establish a boarding facility for those who cannot afford to walk to school because of distances and other reasons. In 2020 one staff house went under construction. It is hoped that before the end of the year 2021 it will have been completed. A 1x3 classroom block is also under construction to accommodate learners since a good number came from Royals  which was temporarily closed. We salute efforts by our directors Mr and Mrs Mutimbire for the wonderful support they give us in the construction of these two projects.

Grade 7 Examinations Centre
The school is now a full fledged examination centre for grade 7 examinations. Our grade 7 students have been writing their final exams for the past 3 sittings. Since Zimsec does require that a school should have a safe to store exams before they are written, this was long put in place before the first examinations  were written.
Development Projects
The school has three more desktops-computers as of last year. This was done to reduce the ratio per learners in the computer lab. More computers however are needed. Learners are however allowed to bring their own laptops during ICT lessons, since we are promoting e-learning. Through other fund-raising projects we could acquire more desktops and laptops. The school has opened its doors to the community for those who would like to study computers. In future we wish to have a Hexco centre, which gives an apportunity to sit for this as a professional course. We are appealing to well wishers to assist us by any donations. We can be found on facebook as Regisbridge Private Primary School.
Foreigh Language at School
Our policy as a school is to produce a competent learner who can fit in any environment. As a result we have introduced a foreign language, that is French.We have therefore engaged a French teacher who teaches all learners from ECD to grade 7. Adult classes are also open to the community at a fee. You can come and register to add value to your careers. Again we are appealing to those who can assist us with pamphlets, books, flyers etc in French project. Very soon another local language will be on the cards. This time, it is sign language, the language that is used by deaf people. Volunteer teachers have already been identified from local churches.
Income Generaling Projects
The school is engaged in gardening and farming as income generating projects. The maize plant is now ready for harvesting. The next projects to be embarked on soon will be bee-keeping and chicken rearing. It is hoped that these will bring the much needed Income to the school.
Class Branding
“If one looks wise, it is easy to become wise” so say the wise people. These are ideas of great thinkers. We want our learners to be essociated with greatness so that they will not be limited in all their endevours, We have branded all our classrooms blocks and classes with unique names in the kingdom of educationists and birds. Below are the names 
Below are the names of each block and classes

Regisbridge School Hymn Books
Music is a powerful language, It has the pontential to mould ones behaviour or character, Some dress codes are associated with the type of music one listens to. Music has the potential to give, comfort, or motivate someone to follow a centain teaching or lesson. As a school we want our learners to learn through diverse ways including music, so that we raise a child who is not only academically excellent but also morally and emotionally upright. Hence this term we will be singing the National Antemn together with our brand school song. Our kids will as well recite the National pledges at Assembly.
Reading Programme
We are continuing to take our reading home. The reading programme is a joint venture between parents and their kids with the teacher spear-heading the programme. On a daily basis, kids are given home-work on reading, right from ECD to Grade 7. Parents should make sure their kids read. Any challenges encountered, the teachers are always ready to assist in order to overcome any obstacles. To monitor the reading progress of learners we are going to continue with ready-made reading communication books especially in infant classes. The parents and teacher will work together to monitor and comment progress made by learners.
Sports
Although this season has been dedicated to athletics we have found it extremely difficult to organise sports due to the Covid 19 pandemic. The Ministry of Education has not given us a clear mandate to hold competitions as we would have liked. The school is patiently waiting for communication from Ministry in this regard. Mean-while we have grouped our learners into houses so as to hold Interhouse competitions. We intend to do the following competitions at school and at Zonal competitions.
Interhouse competitions
Inter school competitions
Zonal competitions
As Private schools we have met and formed our own zone with the following schools. Munashe, Maranatha, Turf 2, Otfields, Good Shephard and Regisbridge. Our zone will be known as Turf Urban zone, We therefore intend to compete in athletics, ball games, music, chess, quiz and many more. After athletics next term we intend to compete in ball games. Parents who can assist us coaching in any of the disciplines are welcome.
Our sports houses still remain the same ie
Aquilla
Sparta
Fraser
Transportation of Learners to school
We have engaged some Private transporters to ferry our learners to and from school everday at a fee. There are two Kombies that ferry these learners first Grade 1-7 and later the ECDs. The SDC chairperson is in charge of co-ordinating parents and learners and the transporter.
Below is the time table of Kombis
Primary	Bedrooms	From	0615-0700am
	Co-house	From	0630-0730am
ECD	Bedrooms	From	0715-0815am
	Co-house	From	0715-0830am

Parents are hereby advised to pay transport costs in advance as to make sure  their kids are transported. The costs at presentis $16.00 per month. The SDC chair has decided herself to accompany the drivers and kids during mornings and afternoons. We therefore kindly request parents to co-operate with her. However we have conductors to assist all the time. It is in general domain that some parents feel if they could have their own vehicle then some of problems will have to be alleviated. 
Annual General Meeting for 2021 (AGM)
The school Annual General meeting was held on 17 April 2021. We apologize to parents that such meetings are normally held within the following months October, November December January and February. However due to Covid 19 again this could not happen. Schools were closed and opened on 22 March for serious business. As a result confusion was made amongst parents as well as the preparations for the AGM.
School fees 2021
The Annual General meeting came up with the Annual  school fees of $225.00USD for Grade 1-7 and $180.00USD for ECD per term. It is hoped that the next fees review would be there for January 2022. For all programmes to run smoothly there is need for prompt fees and levy payments. Please pay in advance during holidays to avoid disappointments. Use the following payment systems.
Cash in USD @ The school office 
RTGS or intenal transfers through the following banks 
Bank	Account No
Zb bank	4550- 106026-080
Banc Abc	13963985402108



ECD and Grade 1 Orientation
There was need to have orientation day with parents of ECDs and Grade ones learners. Although grade ones are used to the school, it is anticipated that some could have come from other learning Centres. This day is put aside to make sure parents of ECD learners get to know the environment in which their kids were going to spend time in 
Civvies and Tuckshop Day
Our civvies and tuckshop day is going to be held on Wednesday 12 May 2021. On this day we will be fundraising by selling different items to our learners. Parents are therefore kindly requesting to support this day by giving their kids the required money. There is some minimum specific monies to be paid to grace the day. Joining fee for ECD is $1.00USD and $2.00USD for Grade 1 to 7. Parents are free to give generously as this will make their school grow.
End of Term Tests and Consultation
Our end of term tests from Grade 1 to 7 will be written as from 17 to 28 May 2021. After that then we will have the consultation day as from 31 May to 2 June. Schools close on 4 June 2021. The office of the Head is always open to discuss issues and challenges concering our kids performances. Personalised consultations appointments will be issued a week before the consultation day 
School Calendar
